## Inspiration
We decided to build ThriveHer because supporting small businesses and womenx entrepreneurs/business owners is always a pressing issue, but even more so now during the pandemic. We hope this will be a valuable tool for women and non-binary entrepreneurs to form local connections with one another, gain traction in the small business world, and find the key insights they need to make the next leap in their businessesâ€™ journeys. We hope this will empower more women to build successful, influential businesses that will really benefit the whole community!

## What it does
Through ThriveHer, users can gain funding for their entrepreneurial ideas and learn from experienced mentors through 1-1 conversations.

## Tools we used
- Flask app (Python)
- mongoDB for storing user info and mentor-mentee conversations
- HTML/CSS, Bootstrap for frontend
- JavaScript, frontend
- AJAX, JQuery, SocketIO, for instant chat feature
